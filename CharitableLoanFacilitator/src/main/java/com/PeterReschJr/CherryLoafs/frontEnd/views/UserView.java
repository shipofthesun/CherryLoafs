/**
 * Represents a user or guest's main view of the application.  This is with search bar located at 
 * top and search results list if any underneath.  Could insert ads into this list for monetization.
 * I was also contemplating adding a side bar on both far sides of the screen devoted to ads.  So,
 * the search bar and results list would be centered and flanked by advertisements if desired.
 * On mobile the ads usually reserved for the side bars could be interspersed into the results.
 * If no results are present, a list of ads could display by default.  These would need to be marked
 * very clearly as ads and there can be no way someone would ever mistake it as a Project result.
 * If this is impossible to achieve, so be it.  I would not want to take a monetization course that
 * may reduce the effectiveness of the application.
